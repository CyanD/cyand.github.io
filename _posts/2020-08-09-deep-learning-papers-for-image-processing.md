**Draft**

I am new to the domain of image and vision process. Here are some note when reading papers in this domain.

# YOLO: an approach of object detection
Paper from Facebook AI Research [1].

## Terminology
1. Repurpose: Prior work repurposes classifieds to perform detection
2. Astounding: an astounding 155 frames per seconds
3. Deformable: deformable parts
4. Refreshingly simple
5. Frame: 1) speech frame 2) frame detection as a regression problem
6. Artwork: test on artwork


# Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks

Paper from Shaoqing Ren and Kaiming He, 2016.
