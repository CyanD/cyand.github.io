title: 1x1 Conv is the same to FC layer
---

The 1x1 conv can be converted into a FC layer. Here is the PyTorch code to prove that.

``` python
import torch
from torch import nn

m = nn.Conv2d(16, 33, kernel_size=1, stride=1)
input = torch.randn(20, 16, 50, 100)
output1 = m(input)

fc = nn.Linear(16, 33)
fc.weight.data = m.weight.squeeze()
fc.bias.data = m.bias
output2 = fc(input.transpose(1, 3)).transpose(1, 3)

print("--- max diff", (output2 - output1).abs().max())
```

Output:

``` 
--- max diff tensor(7.1526e-07, grad_fn=<MaxBackward1>)
```

The output of conv and fc is almost the same.
